# Ex.No:2
# Ex.Name: Write a CPP program to overload the (+) operator to add two objects both the objects will have the details of a Box i.e their height, length, breadth, and calculate their volume and then using the overloaded operator Add the length, breadth and height of the two objects and store into another object and calculate the volume of the third object.

## Aim:
To write a C++ program to overload the + operator for adding two objects of a Box class. Each object contains height, length, and breadth. After addition, compute the volume of the resultant object.

## Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Define a class Box with three data members: height, length, and breadth.
3. Define a constructor to initialize the box dimensions.
4. Define a method volume() to calculate and return the volume of the box.
5. Overload the + operator to add the dimensions of two Box objects and return a new Box object.
6. In main(), create two objects of the Box class and display their dimensions and volumes.
7. Use the overloaded + operator to create a third object whose dimensions are the sum of the first two objects.
8. Display the dimensions and volume of the third object.
9. End the program.

## Program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std ;

class Box {
   public:
      double getVolume(void) {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }
      void setLength( double len ) {
         length = len;
      }
      void setBreadth( double bre ) {
         breadth = bre;
      }
      void setHeight( double hei ) {
         height = hei;
      }
      Box operator+(const Box& b) {
         Box box;
         box.length = this->length + b.length;
         box.breadth = this->breadth + b.breadth;
         box.height = this->height + b.height;
         return box;
      }
      
   private:
      double length;      
      double breadth;     
      double height;      
};
int main() {
   Box Box1;             
   Box Box2;       
   Box Box3;           
   double volume = 0.0;
   double a,b,c;
   cin>>a>>b>>c;
   Box1.setLength(a); 
   Box1.setBreadth(b); 
   Box1.setHeight(c);
   cin>>a>>b>>c;
   Box2.setLength(a); 
   Box2.setBreadth(b); 
   Box2.setHeight(c);
   volume=Box1.getVolume();
   cout<<"Volume of Box1 : "<<volume<<endl;
   volume = Box2.getVolume();
   cout<<"Volume of Box2 : "<<volume<<endl;
   Box3=Box1+Box2;
   volume=Box3.getVolume();
   cout<<"Volume of Box3 : "<<volume<<endl;
   return 0;
}

```

## Result:
The program successfully overloads the + operator to add two Box objects by summing their dimensions and then calculates the volume of the resultant box.
